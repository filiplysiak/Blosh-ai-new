# Updates Completed

## 1. Fixed Download Issue ✓
**Problem**: Downloaded files were coming as `docx.html` instead of actual DOCX files.

**Solution**: 
- Updated the `/api/brand-analyzer/download` endpoint in `backend/app.py`
- Added proper MIME types for each file type (DOCX, XLSX)
- Added `download_name` parameter to `send_file()` to ensure correct filename
- Now files download with correct extensions and can be opened properly

## 2. Settings System ✓
**Problem**: Competitor brands were hardcoded in the analyzer code.

**Solution**:
- Created `settings.json` in the platform root with configurable settings:
  - `competitor_brands`: List of brands to analyze
  - `primary_brand`: Main brand for focused analysis (FREEBIRD)
  - `thresholds`: Configurable analysis thresholds
- Added Settings API endpoints (`GET /api/settings`, `POST /api/settings`)
- Created Settings page in frontend with clean UI to manage brands
- Updated `analyzer.py` to read brands from `settings.json` dynamically
- Settings button added to sidebar (above logout, grey/white styling)

### Settings Features:
- Add/remove competitor brands
- Set primary brand for analysis
- Clean, simple interface matching Blosh style
- Changes persist across analyses

## 3. Trends Dashboard ✓
**Problem**: No way to visualize data over time from multiple analyses.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive Trends view with tab navigation
- Added "Analyses" and "Trends" tabs in Brand Analyzer

### Trends Features:
- **Line chart visualization** showing metrics over time
- **Brand filtering**: Select any brand or "ALL" for group average
- **Metric selection**: 
  - Omzet Index
  - Doorverkoop %
  - Rentabiliteit
  - Marge %
  - OS (Voorraadrotatie)
- **Statistics cards** showing:
  - Latest value with change indicator (↑/↓)
  - Average across all weeks
  - Minimum value
  - Maximum value
- **Smart data parsing**: Handles % signs, € symbols, etc.
- **Responsive design**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Empty state**: Shows helpful message when < 2 analyses exist

### How It Works:
1. Upload multiple weekly analyses
2. Switch to "Trends" tab
3. Select a brand and metric
4. See performance trends over time with visual chart
5. Identify patterns, improvements, or issues at a glance

## 4. UI Improvements ✓
- Settings button styled like upload button (grey background, white on hover)
- Positioned above logout in sidebar
- Tab navigation with clean underline indicator
- Consistent black/white/grey color scheme throughout
